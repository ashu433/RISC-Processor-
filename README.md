# RISC-Processor-
The given Verilog code is for the design of the 6 stage Pipeline RISC Processor in which all the data and the control Hazard have been successfully removed and also forwarding unit have been realized to improve the IPC . The given code is simulated in the Altera Quartz II
The simulation of the results has also been attatched here.
